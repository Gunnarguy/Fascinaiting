The HTML structure is clean and semantic, using appropriate tags for different sections of the page.
The navigation menu is responsive and uses a hamburger menu for smaller screens, enhancing the user experience on mobile devices.
The use of CSS flexbox for the Gumroad container and social links ensures proper alignment and responsiveness.
The CSS styles are well-commented, making it easier to understand the purpose of each section.
The font sizes are defined using viewport units (vw), which allows them to scale proportionally based on the screen size. However, be cautious when using viewport units for font sizes, as they may become too small or too large on certain devices. Consider using a combination of relative units (em or rem) and media queries to ensure optimal readability across different devices.
The CSS code follows a consistent naming convention, using lowercase letters and hyphens for class names, which is a good practice.
The use of CSS variables for colors, font family, border radius, and box shadow promotes consistency and makes it easier to modify the overall theme of the website.
The social links and footer sections are styled appropriately, with proper alignment and spacing.
